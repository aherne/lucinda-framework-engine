# Lucinda Framework Engine API

This API implements components of [Lucinda Framework 3.0](http://www.lucinda-framework.com) that are owned by framework, open for composer update but not open for change by developers.

API is fully PSR-4 compliant, only requiring PHP7.1+ interpreter and SimpleXML extension. It has 100% Unit Test coverage, using [UnitTest API](https://github.com/aherne/unit-testing) instead of PHPUnit for greater flexibility.
